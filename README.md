# CSC429 Project
This was the final project for my CSC429 Computer Science course.
# Program Synopsis
This program allows you to encrypt or decrypt any type of file. It also provides the functionality of generating public and private keys.

Encryption types available are AES and RSA. Keep in mind RSA has a file size encryption limit of 256 MB. If the file in question is larger then it is preffered to encrypt using AES and use RSA to encrypt AES's private key.
